It is hard to balance what is written in the record compared to what the customer intended to indicate and thus how well the contact center agent is performing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reporting Analysts and Quality Analysts do not have a way to overwrite the result of a Customer Satisfaction score; however, the agents, supervisors, and Quality Analysts did desire a way to appeal the results of a Customer Satisfaction score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI developed this application \"from soup to nuts\" as a full stack developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI added a few additional Schema's and Tables to the existing \u003ca href=\"../../blog/projects/contact-center-master-roster\"\u003eMasterRoster\u003c/a\u003e database. The design of this database was unique in which a number of the tables were load tables to take information from Telecom (Genesys / I3) system which would be used by the Reporting Analyst team to use as a new source of truth for CSAT reporting. I decided stil not to alter the data coming in from the telecom system, but approval CSAT removals would not appear in views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application was written using .NET Framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI programmed an API middleware that would take a request where the consumer would provide an Interaction Id, and the service would return CSAT data related to that Interaction Id. As a Supervisor is filling out the form to request a CSAT removal they could provide the Interaction Id, and then they woud click on a \"Validate / Populate\" button. The API would be invoked and the form fields would auto populate with the data that was returned from API, and then they could explain their reasons for the removal, and it would then go through the approval work-flow. Once approved the CSAT was removed from the view that the Reporting Analysts would use for calculating CSAT scores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application went live on February 1st 2020.\u0026nbsp; It is used by all Supervisors at the contact center on an as needs basis, a handful of Quality Managers (who review and approve / deny removal requests).

Such that the heiararchy, capabilities, and availability of these contact center agents could be known by a Workforce Management team, as well as by Service Line Directors, Managers, and Supervisors. They also needed to have performance metric data about these employees as well as One on Ones, and Absences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI developed this application \"from soup to nuts\" as a full stack developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI designed the Microsoft SQL Server Database Structure. This design was especially important because it would be used as the backbone for other applications to be built on top of. I was aware that I was going to be able to setup some ETL processes from Human Resources, Windows, and Reporting Analyst teams in to this database. Thus this database was designed to have multipe Schema's and tables in those Schema's rather than all tables going to the dbo Schema.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe standard adopted by the Web Development team that I am on chose ASP.NET Framework with Entity Framework as the server side framework to work with. So from a support stand point this was the framework used. Many Models, Views (allot of JavaScript for each view), and Controllers were developed in order to support all of the business processes that were requested by the stake holders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis application needed many ETL processes setup for it. Rather than SSIS packages, I chose to develop a series of Console Applications using TopShelf and Fluent Scheduler to turn the Console Application in to a microservice that could be hosted on other application servers. A particular advantage to this was that I was able to use a \"Core\" class Library that held all of the Database Models, and Entity Framework Context which could be a project reference for the Web Application, and each ETL Console application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe web application and 5 supporting ETL processes went live to production on August 7th, 2019. There have been many incremental updates to the system since then. The solution is still in use today by over 1,600 active Contact Center employees including Directors, Managers and Supervisors and 12 Workforce Management Employees. Not only is this a repository for agent demographics and statistics, but the results of over 23,700 One On One interactions have been recorded between Supervisor and Agent, and Manager and Supervisor as well.\u003c/p\u003e","uuid":"f2518102-4f46-4eb0-bb00-af40dcc13b94","date":1618946270782},{"category":{"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","description":"A collection of Projects that I have been apart of.","uuid":"2ee94573-dd0f-4f8f-a5a5-8c64af57327e","date":1618936509711},"title":"Contact Center Quality Auditing Tracker","slug":"contact-center-quality-auditing-tracker","description":"Capturing and recording the results of a Quality Audit on an interaction might be easy.

Since the items that they are working on are in two different systems it is hard to measure the response time and messages worked. Therefore a web application was requested where the people working the messages could enter generic details about each message they worked such that reporting on how productive they were in achieving service levels was possible. They also needed to keep track of how many messages were remaining to be worked by the end of each shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI developed this application \"from soup to nuts\" as a full stack developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI designed the Microsoft SQL Server Database Structure. This database design was fairly simple. I only needed a few Lookup tables and the main transactional table.

A number of Views were generated to support the data from these worksheets to be displayed in the web app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis particular Web App used ASP.NET Core MVC as it's framework. A particular interesting request for this was to have a \"Start\" / \"Stop\" timer because these employeer's are multi-taskers and must stop working on the message if they reeive a phone call.

His contributions include a tracking and reporting tool for the Transitions of Care and MPHS ED Discharge projects, the implementation of dynamic/interactive workflows, an overhaul of the Master Roster, an Attendance Database, and a more in-depth Improvement Log system. Most notably, he made the upgrade to SharePoint 2013 a seamless project for the PSC by developing a database to track the hundreds of pages requiring validation and producing daily reporting to keep leaders updated on his team's progress. He asked for permission to be in the building at 2:30am on Saturday to verify that all pages were working correctly, and the systems administrator overseeing the upgrade said that, \"I've been through 7 of these migrations and I must say that this is by far the most prepared one I've seen.\" Sean has done more than maintain our SharePoint sites, much more than I ever anticipated could be done when he joined us 11 months ago, and I look forward to the many contributions he will make in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e","uuid":"aab077c7-01c0-4863-ba7b-ea66cd112ed3","date":1619125050989},{"category":{"title":"Achievements / Awards","slug":"achievements-awards","description":"A collection of Educational and Professional Achievements.","uuid":"1eb2ff9f-366f-44f4-a40c-1dcd362ddaab","date":1619105725889},"title":"Distinguished Masters Thesis Award","slug":"distinguished-masters-thesis-award","description":"My Capstone Project / Masters Thesis was based on a project where I introduced AnswerPath as a new Knowledge Management system to the contact center.","content":"\u003cp\u003eMy Capstone Project / Masters Thesis was based on a project where I introduced AnswerPath as a new Knowledge Management system to the contact center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy capstone Professor, and the Dean of the department were so impressed by it that they gave me an additional graduation award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thesis may be downloaded here \u003ca href=\"../../MastersDegreeCapstoneThesesis-ContactCenterKnowledgeManagement.pdf\"\u003eMastersDegreeCapstoneThesesis-ContactCenterKnowledgeManagement.pdf\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is an picture of the plaque that they presented to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"../../DistinguishedThesis.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1014\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","uuid":"ab43aeb5-2cb6-4340-b4e1-01c8ce615e39","date":1619123491407},{"category":{"title":"Achievements / Awards","slug":"achievements-awards","description":"A collection of Educational and Professional Achievements.","uuid":"1eb2ff9f-366f-44f4-a40c-1dcd362ddaab","date":1619105725889},"title":"Master Degree","slug":"master-degree","description":"Master of Science Information Systems Obtained from Independence University on 06/12/2015","content":"\u003cp\u003eI obtained my Master of Science in Computer Information Systems from Independence University on 06/12/2015\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"../../MastersDegree.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"589\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","uuid":"10cc76dd-bbf5-4fd9-ac6f-7ba90c22cf5e","date":1619123118498},{"category":{"title":"Achievements / Awards","slug":"achievements-awards","description":"A collection of Educational and Professional Achievements.","uuid":"1eb2ff9f-366f-44f4-a40c-1dcd362ddaab","date":1619105725889},"title":"Bachelor Degree","slug":"bachelor-degree","description":"Bachelor of Science Computer Science With an Emphasis in Networking Obtained from Stevens-Henager College on 11/30/2013","content":"\u003cp\u003eI obtained my Bachelor of Science Degree from Steven's Henager College on November 30th, 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"../../../BachelorsDegree.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"580\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","uuid":"30eb0209-cf9b-455a-a319-434de5510095","date":1619121312222},{"category":{"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","description":"A collection of Projects that I have been apart of.","uuid":"2ee94573-dd0f-4f8f-a5a5-8c64af57327e","date":1618936509711},"title":"Contact Center Workforce Management Team Request Tracker","slug":"contact-center-workforce-management-team-request-tracker","description":"The contact center work force management team are constantly asked to make updates to telecom system and agent's system.

The most unique thing about this application is that we obtained true real-time row-locking and reporing using SignalR Hubs on the server, and the appropriate SignalR javascript libraries as well as React on the client side. This application is hosted in a Load Balanced environment and so a Backplane for SignalR was necessary. My company does not have Redis at this time so we selected a SQL Server Backplane for SignalR. That way regardless of which server they were connected to, when the applicatoin told the client to refresh the data it would happen for all clients on all servers. Because the data was rendered using React it intelligently only re-rendered portions that were necessary. Plus if someone had a check box marked on a row during the refresh, that check mark would stay checked during that state update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application has made it's way in to production on March 17th, 2021, but has not been used for an outbound call campaign yet.\u003c/p\u003e","uuid":"25074246-20f1-49fc-aa1f-3e9e5ea24e15","date":1619030601909},{"category":{"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","description":"A collection of Projects that I have been apart of.","uuid":"2ee94573-dd0f-4f8f-a5a5-8c64af57327e","date":1618936509711},"title":"Contact Center Peer to Peer Assistance Tracker","slug":"contact-center-peer-to-peer-assistance-tracker","description":"Contact Center's are very well equipped to record interactions that agent's have with customers.

I personally have learned more about JavaScript than C# anyways, so it was challenging some times to understand a Blazor / C# equivelent to what I was trying to accomplish in JavaScript, but it was still possible. And when I just could not find a way around it, I was able to use the JavaScript interop functionality provided by Blazor, but I was able to keep that at a minimum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application went live on March 17th, 2021 and still in use today.

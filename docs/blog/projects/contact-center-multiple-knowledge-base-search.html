Each time a client was obtained a new knowledge management database and web app were set up. While the URLs, connection strings, and permissions were different. The database structure and application structure stayed mostly the same.</p>
<p>As the company progressed, they looked for efficiencies, so naturally one efficiency that was discovered was to have agents trained to take calls from different clients.

<p>I developed this application "from soup to nuts" as a full stack developer.</p>
<p>In this application I was fortunate that each database was at least on the same server. Therefore I could simply connect my web app to the "master" sql server database, and as I generated queries which my web app would use based on the user input I just had to make union queries that were in the form of selecting from [DatabaseName].[SchemaName].[TableName].</p>
<p>I also set it up to scale, so that any time a new knowledge management system was set up that I would add that as a record to a metadata table that was tracking which databases were in scope for each query, and which database mapped to which URL.</p>
<p>This application is using ASP.NET Core hosting a React app. So I first created a RESTFUL API for the React app to consume. Then client side routing and rendering was generated in the react app.</p>
<p>The application went live on September 9th, 2020. I did not put any tracking on to this web app, but I do know that it is being used by more than 800 people making hundreds of queries per day.</p></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"articleData":{"category":{"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","description":"A collection of Projects that I have been apart of.","uuid":"2ee94573-dd0f-4f8f-a5a5-8c64af57327e","date":1618936509711},"title":"Contact Center Multiple Knowledge Base Search","slug":"contact-center-multiple-knowledge-base-search","description":"Sending filter requests to multiple information silos and coming back with baked bread.","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe contact center has been doing well at obtaining new clients.

<p>I developed this application "from soup to nuts" as a full stack developer.</p>
<p>I developed the SQL server database by adding a new Schema and sufficient tables to the existing <a href="../../blog/projects/contact-center-master-roster">MasterRoster</a> database as per the requirements given around what they wanted to have tracked. I also created user defined functions that returned tables and took a few parameters that the reports would be providing to generate the views which the web app would be consuming.</p>
<p>I had just started learning about Blazor and decided that this would be a good project to apply those lessons to. This particular application was made as a Blazor server app (as apposed to a Blazor Web Assembly App).</p>
<p>One thing that I found particularly interesting about coding in Blazor is that it is all C#. In a typical MVC environment you will be coding C# for your Controllers, and Models, and then views are a mixuture of HTML and JavaScript. So being able to rely strictly on one language and not the other was certainly an advantage. I personally have learned more about JavaScript than C# anyways, so it was challenging some times to understand a Blazor / C# equivelent to what I was trying to accomplish in JavaScript, but it was still possible. And when I just could not find a way around it, I was able to use the JavaScript interop functionality provided by Blazor, but I was able to keep that at a minimum.</p>
<p>The application went live on March 17th, 2021 and still in use today. It is used by about 10 people per day and has already recorded 280 assistance requests.</p></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"articleData":{"category":{"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","description":"A collection of Projects that I have been apart of.","uuid":"2ee94573-dd0f-4f8f-a5a5-8c64af57327e","date":1618936509711},"title":"Contact Center Peer to Peer Assistance Tracker","slug":"contact-center-peer-to-peer-assistance-tracker","description":"Contact Center's are very well equipped to record interactions that agent's have with customers.

The desire was to have as much human-to-human contact as possible. The contact center may receive lists on an ad-hoc basis, but they did need a way to split the work up without causing duplication of work, and eliminating as much manual effor as possible. Their first attempt at doing this was with an excel sheet in Teams which does have the capability of real-time collaborative editting, but it still lead to problems.</p>
<p>I developed this application "from soup to nuts" as a full stack developer.</p>
<p>Working with the business we came up with a standard format of an input excel sheet.</p>
<p>I made the web app such that they could upload a spreadsheet that was in that format and it would insert requirement records based on that project. They could choose to have multiple spreadsheets per project, or just one spreadsheet per project if they like. They could also add as many spreadsheets at any time that they like. Once a spreadsheet was uploaded they then had the page load the list of requirements. They have row selectors were they could choose to assign those items to specific individuals, or they could just share the project link with the people that they wanted to jump on and start making calls, and when they clicked a row, that person would automatically lock that record.</p>
<p>This application was designed using .NET Framework. The most unique thing about this application is that we obtained true real-time row-locking and reporing using SignalR Hubs on the server, and the appropriate SignalR javascript libraries as well as React on the client side. This application is hosted in a Load Balanced environment and so a Backplane for SignalR was necessary. My company does not have Redis at this time so we selected a SQL Server Backplane for SignalR. That way regardless of which server they were connected to, when the application told the client to refresh the data it would happen for all clients on all servers. Because the data was rendered using React it intelligently only re-rendered portions that were necessary. Plus if someone had a check box marked on a row during the refresh, that check mark would stay checked during that state update.</p>
<p>The application has made it's way in to production on March 17th, 2021, the first use case of an outbound call campaign began on May 3rd, 2021 to contact 1300 customers. They were able to complete these contacts using approximately 12 people in within 4 hours. The business told me that these lists would some times take weeks to complete. So going from weeks to complete to only 4 hours to complete was a huge impact. They did another list of customers on May 6th as well and had similar results with the similar number of customers to contact.</p></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"articleData":{"category":{"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","description":"A collection of Projects that I have been apart of.","uuid":"2ee94573-dd0f-4f8f-a5a5-8c64af57327e","date":1618936509711},"title":"Contact Center Outbound Call Tracker","slug":"contact-center-outbound-call-tracker","description":"When receiving a customer list to contact how can you be sure a customer is only contacted once, and how close is the list to being complete and in real-time?","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere came a time when the contact center was asked to make outbound calls to a number of customers to follow-up for specific reasons.

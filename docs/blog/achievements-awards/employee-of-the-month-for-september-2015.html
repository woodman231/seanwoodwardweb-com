<hr />
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I would like to nominate Sean Woodward for EOM for September. Since joining the company one year ago, Sean has engineered a number of novel solutions to improve work at the PSC, including the development of custom tools and databases. His contributions include a tracking and reporting tool for the Transitions of Care and MPHS ED Discharge projects, the implementation of dynamic/interactive workflows, an overhaul of the Master Roster, an Attendance Database, and a more in-depth Improvement Log system. Most notably, he made the upgrade to SharePoint 2013 a seamless project for the PSC by developing a database to track the hundreds of pages requiring validation and producing daily reporting to keep leaders updated on his team's progress. He asked for permission to be in the building at 2:30am on Saturday to verify that all pages were working correctly, and the systems administrator overseeing the upgrade said that, "I've been through 7 of these migrations and I must say that this is by far the most prepared one I've seen." Sean has done more than maintain our SharePoint sites, much more than I ever anticipated could be done when he joined us 11 months ago, and I look forward to the many contributions he will make in the future.</p>

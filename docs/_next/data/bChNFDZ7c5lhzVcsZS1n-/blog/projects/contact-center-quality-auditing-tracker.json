But when every agent needs to be audited 4 times a month it is hard to determine how audits have been performed and still need to be performed.","content":"<p>This process started by using the <a href=\"../../blog/projects/contact-center-master-roster\">MasterRoster</a> spreadsheet spoken of before. The Quality Management team at the Contact Center needed the basic demographic information on the agent's so that they could identify who needed to be audited. They also had a policy that each agent would be audited 4 times a month.</p>\n<p>After the MasterRoster was transitioned to a web application, it only made sense to make this the next business process to be transitioned to a web application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I developed this application \"from soup to nuts\" as a full stack developer.</p>\n<p>Due to the design of the MasterRoster database it was easy to add an additional Schema and a few tables to the existing database.</p>\n<p>This is a .NET Framework application and is a sub-app of the main MasterRoster web app when looking at it from an IIS perspective.</p>\n<p>The application went live on October 16th, 2019. The application is used by 10 active Quality Auditors per day. It has recorded over 52,000 audit requirements and over 93,000 audit attempts.</p>","uuid":"303e5724-fe66-409a-8a7b-f459dd10be8c","date":1618945976951}},"__N_SSG":true}
